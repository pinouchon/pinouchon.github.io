From [Deep Convolutional Inverse Graphics Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03167v4.pdf):

> Various work [3, 4, 7] has been done on the theory and practice of representation learning, and from
> this work a consistent set of desiderata for representations has emerged: invariance, meaningfulness
> of representations, abstraction, and disentanglement. 

> In particular, Bengio et al. [3] propose that a
> **disentangled** representation is one for which changes in the encoded data are sparse over real-world
> transformations; that is, changes in only a few latents at a time should be able to represent sequences
> which are likely to happen in the real world.

Sweet.
