There was an author coming up a lot in the papers I read recently; and I think more importantly, he is
one of the few (if not the only one) to have worked with both Hinton and Tenenbaum (two cognitive science /
machine learning researchers I love. Yes, my love stories are weird).

I enjoyed those lectures a lot. He synthesises a lot of ideas together that are often found separately.

 - [Learning Hierarchical Generative Models, Pt. 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nODMf0AjPEs)
 
Kick-ass papers he authored/co-authored:

 - [Skip-Thought Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06726)
 - [Dropout: A simple way to prevent neural networks from overfitting](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/srivastava14a.pdf)
 - [Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/LakeEtAl2015Science.pdf)
 - [Semantic Hashing](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/sdarticle.pdf)
 - [Deep Boltzmann Machines](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/dbm.pdf)

So much good stuff.
