Here is a quick rundown about what I did today:
 - Documented myself about the different deep learning approaches to chatbots
 - There are retrieval and generative models. Both can make use of deep learning techniques
 - Vinyals and Sutskever have good papers: seq2seq and a neural conversational model
 - I managed to schedule my airbnb for the HuggingFace New York trip
 - The approach I want to have for my small chatbot is to fiddle with the semantic space
 of a neural language model (a char rnn or word embedding). Script the manipulation of that
 embedding and see how it affect the output of the network  
 - The AI safety meetup was quite interesting: we discussed the paper "concrete problems
 in ai safety"
 - Began watching a video of Manning about how to do reasoning with neural nets
