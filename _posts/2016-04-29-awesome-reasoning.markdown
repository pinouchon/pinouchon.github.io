My journey into understanding reasoning is getting started.

I was missing a good set of references about the study of reasoning.

In this video: [Development of Intelligence - Josh Tenenbaum: Bayesian Inference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icEdI0AIOlU),
Tenenbaum has a slide about a bunch of authors about different subjects...

For reasoning, we have: Chater, Oaksford, Sloman, McKenzie, Heit, Kemp and Tenenbaum himself.

Based on all that I made up this list:

 - [Josh homepage](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html)
 - [Pr√©cis of Bayesian Rationality: The Probabilistic Approach to Human Reasoning (Oaksford & Chater)](http://matt.colorado.edu/teaching/highcog/readings/oc9.pdf)
 - [The Empirical Case for Two Systems of Reasoning (Sloman)](http://ww.mindstalk.net/indiana/Orals/TwoSystems.pdf)
 - [From machine learning to machine reasoning (Bottou)](http://leon.bottou.org/publications/pdf/mlj-2013.pdf)
