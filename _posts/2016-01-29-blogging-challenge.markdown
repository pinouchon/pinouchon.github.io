To get started, I'll challenge myself with the following:

  - One post everyday. OK to skip one post per week (so >= 6 post/week)
  - Every post is at least 50 words
  - Subject doesn't matter
  - Quality doesn't matter
  - Until 2017-01-01
  
That's a commitment of at least 288 posts and a minimum of 14400 words. (looks manageable !)
 
If all the above is met, I'll consider the experiment a success.
