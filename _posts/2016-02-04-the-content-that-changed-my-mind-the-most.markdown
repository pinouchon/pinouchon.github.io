In this information age, we consume a lot of content. But only a fraction of it we remember, and a smaller
fraction still makes us change our minds. I'll show a brief list of some of the stuff that changed my mind the most.

 - [How to do what you love](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html)
 
Paul Graham articulates very nicely the dynamics and problems about doing what you love.

 - [On saving the world](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jl3/on_saving_the_world/)
 
Nate Soares (so8res) shares his story and how, after much turmoil, he came to reach the same conclusions as 
[MIRI](https://intelligence.org/). Beautiful story and mindset.
In addition to [writing on Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/user/So8res/), 
he has [his own blog](http://mindingourway.com/), that I find fascinating. Before reading it, I had a vague
feeling that MIRI goals where kind of right. After, I could see that they where *the right thing to do*, if
your concern is giving a chance to our descendants (and life in general) to thrive.

 - [How brain science will change computing](https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_hawkins_on_how_brain_science_will_change_computing?language=en)
 
This is the talk that got me interested in AI. Jeff Hawkins argues that we need a theory about intelligence, that it
is not magic, and that it cannot be that complicated. So let's go find what it is.

 - [Simple made easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) by Rich Hickey
  
Almost the same talk at Rails Conf: [Simplicity Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0)

In software development, simplicity is key.

 - [How to Grow a Mind](http://videolectures.net/aaai2012_tenenbaum_grow_mind/) by Josh Tenenbaum
 
One of his ideas is that developmental psychology can really help us learn a lot about how brains work. He also
talks about aspects of intelligence that are really overlooked: common sense understanding, and how the brain seems
to learn rapidly with little information, or

> How does the mind get so much ouf of so little?

 - [Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies](http://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742) by Nick Bostrom
 
A thorough analysis of what a superintelligence is, and the many ways we can achieve it. After reading this book,
it is much clearer that a superintelligence is likely, and we better be prepared. [And we are not prepared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU).

 - [Cosmos series](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081846/) narated by Carl Sagan
 
This series gives you a sense of wonder about our place is the universe.

 - [Hinton AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning/comments/2lmo0l/ama_geoffrey_hinton)
 
Hinton answers a lots of questions from the reddit community.

 - [Schmidhuber AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2xcyrl/i_am_j%C3%BCrgen_schmidhuber_ama)
 
Same with Schmidhuber
