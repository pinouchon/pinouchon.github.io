If you are a bit bored or you don't know what to read next, go there:

 - [http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/papers.html](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/papers.html)
 
Or there

 - [http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/onlinepub.html](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/onlinepub.html)
 
Going there and randomly clicking has been a great strategy over the past months to discover ideas
I didn't even suspect.

More recently, going there: [https://deepmind.com/publications.html](https://deepmind.com/publications.html) has
proven enlightening as well.

I wish those papers were a bit less dense and formal. But at the very least the ideas are top notch. 
Which is what matters.
