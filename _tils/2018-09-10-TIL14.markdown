Summary of today:
Thoughts:
 - Keep going with SOMOD
 - Working right after meditation works fine

Things:
 - Get correct position from exchange
 - Next: create a test scenario to trigger many JIT_SHADOW trader_runs
 - And next: check candles and predictions
 - Checked gym, ordered barbell instead
 - Carrefour is good. Ran some errands: including goddamn keys
 - Finally got the creatine
 - Checked some TRP: Non-neediness, outcome independence, care-free attitude.. 
   all of this comes when you find something more fulfilling than pussy. Suddenly 
   the value of it plummets and you realise you don't need anything but you and your mission.
