> “We don't rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the 
level of our training.” ― Archilochus.* 

My name is Benjamin Crouzier. Most of the time, I am a coding, meditating, 
lifting, juggling, blogging and self-improving.

I'm on a big mission to create and AGI and have some fun with it. To reach that goal, my plan is
a multistage rocket:

 - Create an [algorithmic trader](https://github.com/tufa)
 - To finance a [research startup](http://tufa.ai)
 - To study AI/ML/reasoning
 - To build a safe AGI
 - Then use it to automate most of everything, mind upload ourselves, 
   hack into the parent universe and 
   answer hard philosophical questions such as how to pronounce gif. 
   
I am committed and willing to put in all the hard work necessary to make that happen.
