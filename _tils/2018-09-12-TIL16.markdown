Summary of today:
Thoughts:
 - leaning no-EF
 - difficulty banging code with all Tufa/EF snafus 

Things:
 - Youtube fast still going strong
 - Quite a bit of admin/calls/discussion for EF vs no EF
 - Call Elspeth => big selling. Don't worry everything is fine
 - Call Stevie => Shit smells bad. I wouldn't touch it 
 - EF: no tech founder. Paris cohort admins: no tech either. Is it too much to ask
   from an investor? No. Stevie approves
 - Update founders agreement
 - Create tufa time tracking document
