My little quest to find a theory of reasoning is having some hiccups. I'<!--

[previously](http://pinouchon.github.io/ai/2016/02/01/AGI-what-is-missing.html), 
but it's all hazy and unclear.

So I'll take a little detour in the field of neuroscience. Luckily, 
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and 
[Edx](https://www.edx.org/) have
me covered with two courses which I highly recommend:

 - **Computational Neuroscience**, University of Washington, on Coursera
   + [Course details](https://www.coursera.org/course/compneuro)
   + [Course link (need to be signed in)](https://class.coursera.org/compneuro-003)
   
 - **BIO465x Neuronal Dynamics**, EPFL, on Edx
   + [Course details](https://courses.edx.org/courses/EPFLx/BIO465x/2013_OND/info)
   + [Course link (need to be signed in)](https://courses.edx.org/courses/EPFLx/BIO465x/2013_OND/courseware)

Hopefully I'll come back with some insights for my reasoning theory. After all, the brain implements
human-level-intelligence, so there must be some clues lurking inside.
