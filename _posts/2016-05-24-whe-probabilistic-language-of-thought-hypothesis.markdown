In this video, Noah Goodman presents his ["Probabilistic Language of Thought Hypothesis"](https://youtu.be/239aVfgJ-0E?t=20m57s):

> Mental representations (concepts) are functions in a stochastic lambda calculus (eg. Church).

It seems crazy indeed. A thought, or the meaning of a sentence, would be an expression in a probabilistic language.
Even more crazy is that it seems to work.

It can model complex reasoning (in the video at around 25:13) and communication (44:56) with some nested
inferences.

Noah Goodman has another great video about Probabilictic languages [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGz0nagM-TA).
I also recommend [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAb-t__RblvPdrfeFBxN81Qb5BwGOH_I).
