Here is a quick rundown about what I did today:
 - I played with period length and the MA-diff strategy of the trader
 - It seems that the MA-diff is helpful, but not that much (maybe something like 20%)
 - I created a mode to switch between MA-diff and no-MA-diff easily, and I fixed the
 visualisation for the case with MA-diff.
 - I exchanged emails with hugging face to setup the week-trial
 -
