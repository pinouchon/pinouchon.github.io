Nancy Kanwisher talks about the 
[Visual word form area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_word_form_area) in this talk:
[What do you mean, "Just Phrenology? (starting at 16:45)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jkxh8oO8mM&t=16m45s)
and at [18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jkxh8oO8mM&t=18m27s), she explains her project:

> The idea would be to scan infants pretty much from birth to get maps of connectivity of
> the brain. And then you scan them later and get functional maps, align them all, and ask:
> which locations of these many regions can be predicted from connectivity ?
> It's in principle answerable, but it might kill me trying to do it. But actually nobody is
> going to fund me anyway.

I think that's a great project, someone please fund it.
