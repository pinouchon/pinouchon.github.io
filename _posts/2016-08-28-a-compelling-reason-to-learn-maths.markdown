In [Intuitive Theories as Grammars for Causal Inference](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Papers/tgn-grammar.pdf),
Josh Tenenbaum et al give a mathematical formalization of their
hierarchical Bayesian framework for causal inference.

But before doing do, they issue a warning, which I think is both spot on and hilarious (p19)

> payoff, we suggest viewing it as a long-term investment.
