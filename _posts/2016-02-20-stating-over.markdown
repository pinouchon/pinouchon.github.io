One week ago, [I made the choice](http://pinouchon.github.io/keyboard/layouts/2016/02/14/screw-it-i-m-learning-qgmlwy.html)
to learn the [QGMLWY layout](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?full_optimization). I knew this was going to be a difficult choice.

My progress has been promising: After the first day (~2hrs of training), I knew the home row. Now, after a week of training with an average
of about 20min of practice each day, I now know the full layout. And I am able to pass the first level in [ztype](http://zty.pe/).
 
Nevertheless, I was proficient in Dvorak when I made the switch, so starting over meant throwing away my previous
training. You can probably guess when the switch occurred:

<div class="image">
  <img src="/images/ztype/ztype_scores.png" alt="" style="height: 250px"/>
</div>

This is a screenshot of my runs in [ztype](http://zty.pe/), a typing game.

Like anything else in life, starting over is not easy. Getting used to a previous skillset and knowingly
giving it up is painfull. But probably worth it. 


So let's move on.
