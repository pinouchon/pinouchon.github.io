Amund Tveit has a nice list about 
[ICLR 2017 papers about unsupervised deep learning](https://amundtveit.com/2016/11/12/unsupervised-deep-learning-iclr-2017-discoveries/)

He also references this lecture by Salakhutdinov: 
[Foundations of Unsupervised Deep Learning (Ruslan Salakhutdinov, CMU)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK6bchqeaN8)

I thought I was following somewhat closely this part of the field. Now I feel like I have been living
under a rock.

Stuff that was new to me:

 - Moment matching networks (eg: [Generative moment matching networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.02761v1.pdf))
 - [pixelRNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06759v3.pdf)
 - [Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v15/larochelle11a/larochelle11a.pdf)
