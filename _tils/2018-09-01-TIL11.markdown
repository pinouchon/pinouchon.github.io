Summary of today:
Thoughts:
 - Still a huge void left by my ravaged oneitis. Expected to blow it up, not in that way
 - Accept the looser state. build status, frame and success slowly.
 - On the whole, this episode probably made me stronger. I learned a shit ton about TRP, game and frame
 - As bad as I felt on the second date, I feel a tiny bit of gratitude to V. You helped me grow.
 - You crushed my frame with your shit tests, but what a great learning experience
 - From now on, I'm working on my frame, posture, body fitness and career (my version of monk mode)
 - Expanding my network and building social skill (as well as sexual skill) will be much easier,
   I expect, with better success and better frame.
 - I'll remember my experience with V as yet another good scar. The bead, it's fucking great that
   you can handle this.
 - In a few words: we're back on the long road.

Things:
 - call coinbasepro api properly and persist candles in db as cache
 - next: work with 5m candles
 - and next: fix the position drift
 - morning routine with running
 - working at the park under the sun, works great (next maybe try juggling in the park)
 - groceries, workout
 - some NEO success
