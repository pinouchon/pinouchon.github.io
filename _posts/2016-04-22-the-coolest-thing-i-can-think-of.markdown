Let's say you were told by someone that is always right that anything you attempt is going to succeed.
What would you try to do ?

In other words, what is the coolest thing you can think of ? 
As a member of Homo Sapiens, a mammal, a living thing, a concious being or whatever, 
what is the radest thing you can do ? The thing that would make your mom (or whoever you are trying to
impress) the most pleased.

I wouldn't try to be original and resort to the [Eliezer scale](http://pinouchon.github.io/ai/2016/02/02/where-are-you-on-the-eliezer-scale.html),
and pick the top item: hack the universe, get out of the system, and say hello to our gods.

With the help of a properly aligned ASI, there is a *slight* chance we manage that in our lifetime.

There is a whole slew of less cool (but still insanely cool by any standards) of other possible things:
wireheading, ASI-generated art and videogames, mind uploading, atomic 3d-printers, eradication of suffering,
thriving global political system... But I 
don't see anything that can top hacking the universe.
