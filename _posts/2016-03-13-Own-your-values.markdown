## Or: Do yourself a favour: bust your [cached values](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/) and [rebuild](http://lesswrong.com/lw/la/truly_part_of_you/) them [from source](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k7/original_seeing/).

This ties back to guilt motivation and self respect. Let me explain:

If you motivate yourself with guilt (eg: I should really do more exercise, I feel bad because I work long hours...), you
create the following situation:
 
 - You give orders to yourself, as if the person giving the orders was someone else 
 - You have no respect for that other person

[The cure to that](http://mindingourway.com/not-because-you-should/)
is to avoid the situation entirely, and ask *what is it that you want to achieve in the first place*.

The basic idea is define things not externally (by copying and caching from others), but internally (through first principles
 and reflection).

By internalising your motivations and desires, you are now able to evaluate them, weight trade-offs, and act accordingly. 

By owning your values, you can understand why they are there. And if something changes down the value chain, you can
update accordingly. And as a side effect, you will be doing what *you* think is best with your life. Not what some 
advertiser, boss or relative think is best. Technically they could, they'll just have to
[convince you](http://blog.codinghorror.com/but-you-did-not-persuade-me/) first.
