Geoffrey Hinton explains CD (Contrastive Divergence) and RBMs (Restricted Boltzmann Machines) 
in this paper with a bit of historical context: [Where do features come from?](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/cogsci14.pdf).
He also relates it to backpropagation and other kind of networks (directed/undirected graphical models, deep beliefs nets, stacking RBMs).

This has stayed open in my chrome tabs for a few months, competing with 18 others for my attention. Tonight I chose this one, and 
I'm glad I did.

If Hinton were James Cameron, I'm sure he would have written great intrigues.

I'll include the next paragraph in case you haven't guessed it already (I didn't, even after 
reading the highly suggestive abstract):

Having "established" that CD is better than backprop, Hinton explains that it can do 3 computations:

 - Perceptual inference
 
> After the weights on the connections have been learned, a Boltzmann machine
> can be made to perform perceptual inference by clamping a datavector on the
> visible units and then repeatedly updating the hidden units, one at a time, by
> turning on each binary hidden unit with a probability that is a logistic function
> of the total input it receives from all the other visible and hidden units (plus its
> own bias).

 - Hallucination
 
> Another computation that a trained Boltzmann machine can perform is to generate
> visible vectors with a probability that equals the probability that the model
> assigns to those vectors. This is done by using exactly the same process as is
> used for perceptual inference, but with the visible units also being updated.

 - Learning (!!!)
  
> The third and most interesting computation that a Boltzmann machine can perform
> is to update the weights on the connections in such a way that it is probably
> slightly more likely to generate all of the datavectors in the training set. Although
> this is a slow process, it is mathematically very simple and only uses information
> that is locally available.

<br/>

CD is one of the techniques used to pre-train Deep Neural Networks, and it played some (how much ?) role in their revival.

Outside of academia, we never hear about contrastive divergence. In my opinion, it hasn't received the attention
it deserves.
