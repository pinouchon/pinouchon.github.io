Summary of today:
 - Went to work in Antoine's place
 - Confirmation of coffee with Dylan and Emil this Friday
 - Did some work connecting Coinbase/CCXT and the trader worker
 - Fought some thoughts about V
 - Helped Antoine make a converging non-causal, FC network on BTCUSD.
 - Got back home, send invitation to V, groceries, workout, eat & chill, loud reading
 - 30m or TRP reading
 => Women want bigger and dominating men because they want to feel safe, and protected from the
    outside world and their own inner bullshit. Ways for men to dominate: physically, mentally,
    socially, financially. Domination is the key to sexual arousal
 => Quote: To be honest I don't know what's more pathetic, a dude who never knew better or a dude who knew better but couldn't handle the truth
 => Quote: This is probably one of the most bitter pills to swallow that there is. You never "just get to be in love." Ever. 
 - This is the first day in a long time I went full green. Fuckyeah
 - And as an added bonus, V is looking forward to my date. But let's not pedestalize this pussy yet, as
   hard as it can be. The universe is going to act nice only if I let it act nice.
