(I am referring to Javascript-the-landscape, not Javascript-the-language)

Javascript is moving very vast. Every week, there is a new slew of libraries.

How well do I fare on javascript awareness ? Surely I am doing ok. If you think you are too, read this
little excerpt from [State of the Art JavaScript in 2016](https://medium.com/javascript-and-opinions/state-of-the-art-javascript-in-2016-ab67fc68eb0b):

> The first criteria knocks out Ava (even though it looks awesome) and Jest (auto-mocking isn’t nearly as nice as it

When you don't watch closely a javascript library, It goes into a corner and makes a lot of babies!
