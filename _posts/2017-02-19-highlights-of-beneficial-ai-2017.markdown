The [BENEFICIAL AI 2017](https://futureoflife.org/bai-2017/) conference has gathered an impressive
panel of thinkers, including Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Andrew McAfee, Demis Hassabis, Ray Kurzweil,
Yann LeCun, Shane Legg, Nick Bostrom, Jaan Tallinn (to name just a few)

The technical talks that I found most interesting are the following:

 - [Interactions between the AI Control Problem and the Governance Problem \| Nick Bostrom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H-uxRq2w-c)
 - [Creating Human-Level AI \| Yoshua Bengio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHYXp3gJCaI)
 - [Provably Beneficial AI \| Stuart Russell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pARXQnX6QS8)
 - [A Path to AI \| Yann LeCun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bub58oYJTm0)
 - [Creating Human-level AI: How and When?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0aXMTpZTfc)
 - [Superintelligence: Science or Fiction? \| Elon Musk & Other Great Minds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0962biiZa4)
 
This talk also was surprising to me:

 - [A FAQ on Tech, Jobs, and Wages \| Andrew McAfee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTBjXq_9JtI)

I didn't know about the idea of Social Decay (that he talks about at around 12:00), and it is quite alarming.
