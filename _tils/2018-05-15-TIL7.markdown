Here is a quick rundown about what I did today:
 - I implemented the "more data" feature: now the trader is trained with BTCUSD
 in addition to BTCEUR. It raises performance from 125 to 148
 - I watched a talk of Manning where he presents the MAC net architecture to have
 neural networks do reasoning tasks. On the clever dataset, this approach performs
 better than DDRProg, FiLM and relation networks. One of the big ideas is to separate
 control from memory in the modules.
