You can view the stanford course about convnets on youtube:
[CS231n : Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLvH2FwAQhnpj1WEB-jHmPuUeQ8mX-XXG)

It is taught by Andrej Karpathy and Justin Johnson.
 
Definitely one of the best courses about deep learning. I cannot believe it is free and so few people have
watched it.
