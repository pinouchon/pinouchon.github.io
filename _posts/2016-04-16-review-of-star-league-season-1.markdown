Quick review of the [main event of the StarLeague season 1](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/2016_StarCraft_II_StarLeague_Season_1/Main_Event).

The big story is that Dark is wrecking everyone.

But there are a couple of other things to notice:

 - Zerg is much more present than I expected it to be.
 - Very few terrans in the RO16 (7 protosses, 6 zergs and only 3 terrans)
 - Protoss is actually having a hard time versus Zerg in the first rounds: the first PvZ won by Protoss is Patience vs Soo 
 in the quaterfinals. After that, it evens out. 
 - her0, one of the favourites, loses 2-1 to Patience and 2-1 to Hurricane; and is out before the quaterfinals.
 - Stats (2nd place) played really well throughout. But he still lost two times to Dark (0-3 in semis and 2-4 in finals)
 - Banelings/Banelings drop in ZvP is meta.
 - Mass phoenix/adepts is frequently played in ZvP.
