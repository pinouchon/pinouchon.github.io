Since high school, I had always been fascinated by intelligence. At the time, this fascination was not strong enough and
shadowed by another one: computers. So I ended up in computer
science school. After graduating, my love for intelligence was still kicking but
I had to earn a living, so I took a job as a programmer; only learning about AI and ML with the little
energy I had left after work. My position as a developer-wannabe-AI-researcher was uncomfortable, so I formed a plan
 to make the best out of my situation. (because my twenties were running out, I had to make a plan, and fast):
 
> Switch careers by quitting my job and studying ML/AI full time on my own, for the longest period that I can afford.
 
With this in mind, it was just a matter of executing properly and not be lured back by attractive job offers for CRUD-type
work that I used to be doing. (CRUD stands for Create Read Update Delete, denoting a type of application that consists mostly of putting
form data into a database, reading it back and displaying it). It it sounds boring, it's because it is.

I other words, my career switch is about "getting
out of the CRUD" and into AI.

The switch leading to my new life actually started two months ago. But before I get into it, let me talk about Candlekeep.


Candlekeep is where you start in the game of Baldur's Gate. It is a fortress-library on top of a crag. You are raised
here by your adoptive father, Gorion. You spend a peaceful childhood here.

Then at some point (which corresponds to the beginning of the game), Gorion tells you the following:

> This is very unnerving, I know, but you must trust me. It is very important that you pack your possessions 
> so that we may leave Candlekeep immediately. Hurry, for there is no time to tarry! 
> The keep is well protected but not invulnerable.

Shortly after leaving you are ambushed by an Armored Figure accompanied by two Ogres and two Thugs, 
one of which does some minor damage to you before Gorion tells you to hide and attempts to fight them off. 
Gorion is murdered in front of your eyes, and so ends the Baldur's Gate Prologue.

And there your are, out in the open, looting the corpse of your dead adoptive father, not sure about what will
happen next.

So what about my new life?

For the most part, it looks like this:

*(just taking a few screenshots of my open tabs)*

And it feels like chapter one has finally begun.
