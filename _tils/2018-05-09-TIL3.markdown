Here is a quick rundown about what I did today:
 - More administrative stafus
 - Call with HuggingFace: good fit, but research is applied. They suggest that I spend a week
   to code a small project in New Work, which I probably will do.
   Overall I'm mostly interested.
   Pluses:
     + probably good package: market pay and options as 10th employee
     + E2 vida, New York
     + good alignment about the research direction and culture
     + comfortable
   Minuses:
     + research is super applied (this is a huge negative point)
     + less choice to follow the research direction that I want: my opinion and preferences
       will matter a bit, but not that much
     + less upside if research goes well 
   With regards to Tufa: more comfortable, less risk, less upside, less freedom, good
   opportunity to reboot my network
 - Visit the doctor
 - Google announced Dupleix, which is a very natural and impressive next step with their 
   assistant. AI and deep learning is definitely here to stay, big tech companies are all
   betting big on AI.
