I don't yet fully understand what probabilistic programming is, but this talk made it a lot clearer:

["An Overview of Probabilistic Programming" by Vikash K. Mansinghka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8QMqSWU76Q)

  <p>
    To a very gross approximation: this is the current process with which you design machine learning
    algorithms. Probabilistic programming is about automating the 3 maths bits (with the sigma symbols)
    on the right that we currently do manually.

In the more rigorous words of Vikash K. Mansinghka:

> Probabilistic inference is a widely-used, rigorous approach for processing ambiguous information based 
> on models that are uncertain or incomplete. However, models and inference algorithms can be difficult 
> to specify and implement, let alone design, validate, or optimize. Additionally, inference often appears 
> to be intractable. Probabilistic programming is an emerging field that aims to address these challenges 
> by formalizing modeling and inference using key ideas from probability theory, programming languages, 
> and Turing-universal computation.

This talk did a lot to help me feel the appeal of probabilistic programming.
