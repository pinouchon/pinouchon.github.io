Here is a quick rundown about what I did today:
 - I checked the HuggingFace interview test
 - I learned about how to do intent classification with word embeddings
 - Most of the bots are some state machines. It's better to work with word-vectors
 and have a machine learning mapping between the intents of the users and different
 lines the bot can say
