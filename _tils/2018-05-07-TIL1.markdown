Here is a quick rundown about what I did today:
 - I found that calculating candles and doing pandas aggregations lazily when loading each
   candle period is too slow. Do most of the aggregations are done before training in a
   eager-loading fashion. This create issues with adding noise and feature engineering.
 - Refactoring of the dataloading of the trader. Using DataLoader, Dataset and ConcatDataset classes.
 - Debugging of the data preparation pipeline
