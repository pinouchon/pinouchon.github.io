Today I stumbled upon Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR). By chance, it ties nicely with
the [last AI-ish post](http://localhost:4000/ai/artificial-reasoning/2016/04/10/inference-and-reasoning-a-quick-glimpse.html)
and the [part-hole paper](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/AIJmapping.pdf).

HRRs are introduced by Tony Plate in this paper: 
[Holographic Reduced Representations](http://www2.fiit.stuba.sk/~kvasnicka/CognitiveScience/6.prednaska/plate.ieee95.pdf)
as well as this book, also by Plate: 
[Holographic Reduced Representation: Distributed Representation for Cognitive Structures](http://www.amazon.com/Holographic-Reduced-Representation-Distributed-Structures/dp/1575864304)

HRRs are also used in this paper: [Associative Long Short-Term Memory](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03032v1.pdf). (This
is also the way I found them). 

I'll admit that right now I don't understand HRRs at all. Hopefully this will get better over time.
