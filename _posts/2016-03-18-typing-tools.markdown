I want to go over the different typing tools to learn to type faster (hopefully to learn another layout)

 - [Typing Cat](http://thetypingcat.com/)
 
Great to discover and learn new layouts. Simple UI, slightly annoying sometimes.

 - [Ztype](http://zty.pe/)
 
Space-invaders style game, type to shoot enemy ships. The game aspect helps to stay focused. The score charts
are nice.

 - [Keybr](http://www.keybr.com/)
 
Standard typing tool. Very customizable. Lots of custom metrics about error rates and progress.
