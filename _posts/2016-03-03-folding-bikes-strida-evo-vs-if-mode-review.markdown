As an actual owner and user of both of these bikes, I will give my impressions about each.

Quick history: I first had the Strida EVO for about one year, and got it stolen. I then bought an IF Mode. 
It's been a year and I still use it. I have used both bikes fairly often (2 to 3 times a week).

# Strida EVO. About $1,300.

Review of the SX version (without the different speeds, but otherwise very similar)

### Pros:

 - Very low-maintenance
 - Very good breaks
 - Very good chain design
 - Can stand by itself while on folded position
 - Good folding design. Easy to walk with the bike folded.
 
### Cons: 

 - Small wheels make the bike more janky and harder to control. It is also more dangerous where there are
 bumps on the road
 - The triangular form of the frame means no standing on the pedals, and you cannot ride no-handed
 - Changing gears by pedaling backwards is very unnatural and requires a lot of getting-used-to
 - Somewhat heavy because of the gears

# IF Mode. About $2,700

### Pros:

 - Very good folding design. Super fast to fold/unfold. Also easy to walk with the bike folded.
 - Good build quality
 - Acts like a normal bike, despite being a folding bike
   + Stable because of large wheels
   + Possible to ride no-handed
   + Possible to ride standing on the pedals
 - Good gear-changing mechanism by tapping with the feet
 - Very cool looking (people sometimes stare at you)

### Cons:

 - Expensive. Which means it will empty your bank account, but also there is the fear of having it stolen, so you'll
  need a very good, also expensive, U-lock. (Better to bring it indoors whenever possible)
 - I had some small technical issues: the saddle sometimes creaks (greasing it fixes the issue), and when changing gears,
 if you do not tap properly, you can end up in a position where the pedals are fully disengaged with the chain. This
 happens very rarely but I have to mention it because it can be surprising.
 - Slightly heavy
 
Overall, both are very good bikes, and I'm very happy with the IF Mode. If I had to remake the choice, 
I would go for the IF Mode again because it is so much like a real bike while still being able to fold.
