Scott Phoenix, cofounder of [vicarious](http://www.vicarious.com/), has this great concept of the "Kiss of death of AI".

From this interview:

> **[Scott]** We're a bunch of phd's in a room. We're solving fundamental research problems on how to
> build generally intelligent systems.
>
> **[Jason (interviewer)]** Huh. With no customers ?
>
> **[Scott]** Well, the customers are infinite. If you can solve this problem...
>
> **[Jason]** But no customers *currently*, I'm saying. It's not like Google, or Yahoo said: "we're
> giving you 10 milling dollars to do X"
>
> **[Scott]** Yeah yeah yeah. That's the kiss of death of AI in my mind for AI research startups: as soon
> as you have your first customer and you haven't solved the fundamental research problems, then you
> start making it more and more narrow. And there you are again stuck in artificial narrow intelligence.
> You haven't cracked the thing.
