Here is a quick rundown about what I did today:
 - Some administrative stafus
 - I read naive set theory. The chapter about inverses, and numbers
 - I worked a bit on the trader: as expected, the generalization behavior is 
   different with different values of fee_damp. But overall the behavior is the
   same than without the dataloader, which is a good sign
 - I watched this video from Koray Kavukcuoglu: 
   [From Generative Models to Generative Agents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5oZIO8pE40).
   He explains the merits of deep RL, their training pipelines, and an approach named SPIRAL
   where they learn to control a tool in a fixed environment. This is a form of program 
   synthesis, the program synthesized being the tool-controlling program. Paper here:
