He is a spanish composer and classical guitarist of the Romantic period. One of the only romantic composers
that I actually like. I highly recommend if you want to put your baby to sleep while also enjoying the music.

And also he composed the nokia tune (in Grad Vals), as well as more some stuff: 

 - [Gran Vals](httpsi://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSQzUx3QW2Y)
 - [Adelita](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrQBNeY-y0A)
 - [LÃ¡grima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgVDl_tElzk)
 - [Rosita (Polka)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uot3lhTG4s)
 
Another good example is this one:

 - [Carnival of Venice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmF0FcazbFc)
 
I think I've found what I like most about this music: he makes skillful use of modern music writing
techniques. The techniques are used lightly without becoming the
focus. Remembering what is it you are trying to achieve, and using the right tools along the way without
being carried away by them or their use, is important.

If Tarrega were programming in a modern programming language (say java or ruby), 
he would make no abuse of OO and metaprogramming,
and you could still read it.
