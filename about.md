My name is Benjamin Crouzier. I am a lifting, coding, juggling, blogging, meditating 
and generally self-improving faster than you are.

I'm on a big mission to create and AGI and have some fun with it. To reach that goal, my plan is
a multistage rocket:

 - Create an algorithmic trader
 - To finance a research startup
 - To study AI/ML/reasoning/understanding hard
 - To build a safe AGI
 - To automate most of everything, mind upload ourselves, hack into the parent universe and 
   answer the hard questions including how to pronounce gif.
