Hammerspoon is a utility for mac that turns Lua code into UI behaviour, the same way Karabiner turns XML
code into keys remapping.

It will be my tool of choice for interacting with the UI: focusing, moving and resizing windows around.

It is a descendant of the (defunct and/or inactive 
[slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) and 
[mjollnir](https://github.com/sdegutis/mjolnir))

A couple of references: 

 - Good article about using mjolnir: 
[Using Mjolnir: An Extensible OSX Window Manager](http://thume.ca/howto/2014/12/02/using-mjolnir-an-extensible-osx-window-manager/)

 - Old article about slate: 
[Using Slate: A Hacker's Window Manager for Macs](http://thume.ca/howto/2012/11/19/using-slate/)

 - **Superb documentation and getting started of Hammerspoon**:
[Getting Started with Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/go/)
This writeup has made it super easy to get my hands on Happerspoon. I wish more documentation was like that.

The last step of my remapping story will be to write the application-focusing hotkeys 
(the binding with Karabiner is done, so I can have a Karabiner hotkey invoking a Hammerspoon action).
 
And then I will be done. (Apart from learning emacs, and writing [DIAL](http://pinouchon.github.io/tools/productivity/2016/04/18/introducing-dial.html), but that's another story)
