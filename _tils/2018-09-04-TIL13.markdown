Summary of today:
Thoughts:
 - Moving on: a very important skill, be it for relationships or a todo list item.
 - Learn to speak. Keep doing BTP (or loud reading). Do read along, ghost-reading, red-aloud
 - Be more selfish. I should do things for myself first, and I'll always be a little alone inside.
   And that's fine
 - Remember: we don't rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training

Things:
 - Fix candle cache 5m
 - setup tests
 - help Antoine with convergence
