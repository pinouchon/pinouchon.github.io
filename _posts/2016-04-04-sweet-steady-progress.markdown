50 days ago, [I gave up my hard-won Dvorak typing speed in favor of QGMLWY](http://pinouchon.github.io/keyboard/layouts/2016/02/14/screw-it-i-m-learning-qgmlwy.html).

But I kept practicing (forcing myself at least 1 minute of practice everyday, and averaging about 25.6m per day, so a 
total of 21.36 hours. More than the expected "5 to 10 hours", but still).
 
And the good thing is that, as computing price, it is going up in a smooth and predictable fashion.

Keep practicing, and success will hit eventually.
