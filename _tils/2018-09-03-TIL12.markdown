Summary of today:
Thoughts:
 - Didn't manage high work hours today. Slipped up with pg video (good tough) 
 - Starting a startup is like catching a dragon by the tail (if you're successful)
 - Researched creatine. Looks beneficial.

Things:
 - Good badminton
 - Still good 2h of work
 - candle5m and api rate limit done
 - next up is hooking with the API and working on the position drift
