I want to go over two recent interviews of Jürgen Schmidhuber (Director of IDSIA), and Demis Hassabis (founder of Deep Mind).

#[Will AI Surpass Human Intelligence? Interview with Prof. Jürgen Schmidhuber on Deep Learning](http://www.infoq.com/articles/interview-schmidhuber-deep-learning)

Highlights:

> InfoQ: Can machines learn like a human?

> Schmidhuber: Not yet, but perhaps soon. See also [this report on “learning to think”](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09249)
> Unsupervised data 
> compression (as in the previous question) is a central ingredient of RNN-based adaptive agents that exploit 
> RNN-based predictive world models to better plan and achieve goals. We first published on that line of research 
> in 1990, and have made a lot of progress since then.

> InfoQ: Your team won nine international pattern recognition competitions, such as handwriting recognition and 
traffic sign recognition, to name just a few. How did you achieve this

> Schmidhuber: [...] 
> How did the team achieve this? Through creativity, persistence, hard work and dedication.

We tend to forget that !

> InfoQ: What are your latest research interests regarding deep learning or artificial intelligence?

> Schmidhuber: My latest research interests are still the ones I formulated in the early 1980s: "build an AI 
> smarter than myself such that I can retire.” This requires more than plain deep learning. It requires self-referential 
> general purpose learning algorithms that improve not only some system’s performance in a given domain, but also the 
> way they learn, and the way they learn the way they learn, etc., limited only by the fundamental limits of 
> computability. I have been working on this all-encompassing stuff since my 1987 diploma thesis on this topic, 
> but now I can see how it is starting to become a practical reality.

#[DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis on how AI will shape the future](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/10/11192774/demis-hassabis-interview-alphago-google-deepmind-ai)

> The verge: So what are your far-off expectations for how humans, robots, and AIs will interact in the future? 
> Obviously people’s heads go to pretty wild sci-fi places.

> I don’t think much about robotics myself personally. What I’m really excited to use this kind of AI for is science, 
> and advancing that faster. I’d like to see AI-assisted science where you have effectively AI research assistants 
> that do a lot of the drudgery work and surface interesting articles, find structure in vast amounts of data, 
> and then surface that to the human experts and scientists who can make quicker breakthroughs. I was giving a 
> talk at CERN a few months ago; obviously they create more data than pretty much anyone on the planet, and for 
> all we know there could be new particles sitting on their massive hard drives somewhere and no-one’s got around 
> to analyzing that because there’s just so much data. So I think it’d be cool if one day an AI was involved in 
> finding a new particle.
