For any good programmer constantly improving his toolbelt, exploring and assessing new programming languages is very
natural. Assuming programming languages vary in power - [and they do](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html) - some
have to be at the top.

And what's at the top ? [Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html)

Then why aren't we all programming in lisp ? Something is wrong with the claim, or we are all stupid. 
Or maybe [something else](http://www.winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html) is going on.

Some people have gone to [crazy lengths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X69_42Mj-g) to get the chance to work with
lisp, so there is definitely something going on. You can even do [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg3XOfioapI)
and [design patterns](http://mishadoff.com/blog/clojure-design-patterns/).

So my recommendation is: give lisp a little bit of love.
