From [this interview with Stephen Wolfram](https://www.edge.org/conversation/stephen_wolfram-ai-the-future-of-civilization):

(In the video at 54:45)

> The great frontier 500 years ago was literacy. Today, it's doing programming of some kind. Today's programming will be obsolete in not very long. For example, when I was first using computers in the '70s, people would say, "If you're a serious programmer, you've got to be using assembly language." Now, I often ask these computer science graduates, "Did you learn assembly language?" They say, "Yes, I had one class about assembly language."
>
> Why do people not learn assembly language? because computers are better at writing assembly language than humans are, and it's only a very small set of people who need to know the details of how language gets compiled into assembly language. A lot of what's being done by armies of programmers today is similarly mundane. It's stuff where the goals can be described much more succinctly, and it turns into some giant blob of Java code or JavaScript code or something. There's no good reason for humans to be writing all that stuff.
>
> That's what people like me try to doâ€”automate that, so we can automate the process of programming, so what's important is just going from what the human wants to do to getting the machine, as automatically as possible, to get that done.

So there you have it. Today's programming is turning succinct goals into some giant blob of
javascript code. Pretty accurate.
