Let's consider the "mission" of some of the leading AI organisations:

[Vicarious](http://www.vicarious.com/) haven't publicly said what its mission is, but it's probably very close.

Related to this is the goal of [Jürgen Schmidhuber](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/):

> Since age 15 or so, the main goal of professor Jürgen Schmidhuber has been to build a self-improving 
> Artificial Intelligence (AI) smarter than himself, then retire.

It's as if we all have the same mission. (AI people at least)

Many people are coming to the conclusion that the best path forward - the most
efficient way to achieve great things - is to automate away the engine that led to so many discoveries: ourselves.
