Experts [are pretty sure](http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/survey.pdf)
that the elusive 
[ANI](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) to 
[AGI](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html), 
and then the rapid AGI to ASI transitions will be occurring
within our lifetimes.

Which is a good thought to have in the back of your mind when pondering the question:
"What the hell should I do with my life ?"

We each are in the position, if we choose, to influence (even if ever so slightly) the course of human 
history at one of its most interesting turning points: when we 
[give birth](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/496012177103663104) to digital superintelligence.
It is time to help humanity to not win at 
[genocide bingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kDPxbS6ofw).

Our current condition may not last for longer than a few decades. In the grand scheme of things,
it will likely be a very brief and temporary state, but one during which most of the future 
will be decided. So we better make the most of it.
