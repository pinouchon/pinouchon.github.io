[@ThePracticalDev](https://twitter.com/thepracticaldev) has a lot of good books recommendations. I'll comment some of them.

Now a crucial skill every good programmer should have.

Pro-tip for advanced JIRA users: take the time to add ["Pebkac"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error) to the list 
of possible issue resolutions. This way,
you will be able to close most of your issues as "Pebkac" and finish your sprint in no time.

This is the often overlooked step that will get you to the precious Stackoverflow thread from which you can copy-paste.

Pro-tip for advanced users: at the top of your source files, add the following comment:
 
`=== GENERATED CODE. DO NOT EDIT. ANY CHANGES WILL BE UNDONE ===`.


You don't want the intern to mess with your code.

I think this version is a bit old. You should wait and buy the new edition: "Rewriting your front end every four weeks".

If you are lucky like me and your boss knows that there is no time to write tests, you will not need this book.
