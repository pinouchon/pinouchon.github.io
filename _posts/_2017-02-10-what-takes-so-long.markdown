Today I want to address a simple question in developmental psychology: why does learning takes so long?
Going from a baby in the womb to a grownup adult takes about 20 years, or 630 million seconds,
or 7300 nights, or a gazillion of synapses operations...

What might be the limiting factor in the development of intelligence?

 - Training data, hinton: small-data regime
 - Prior knowledge acquisition
 - Hypothesis formation
 - Hypothesis validation/rejection (learning a theory of causality)
 - Problem is hard
 - Slow to build hypothesis on top of each other (kanwisher)

Bottleneck at the computational level or implementation/wetware level?
