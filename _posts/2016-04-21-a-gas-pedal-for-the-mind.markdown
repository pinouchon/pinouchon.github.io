I've [hinted before](http://pinouchon.github.io/productivity/self-improvement/distrations/2016/02/12/a-framework-for-dealing-with-distractions.html)
some of the [tools](http://pinouchon.github.io/productivity/self-help/self-improvement/2016/02/11/self-deception-cookies.html)
I use to boost productivity. Today I'll go over the main one. It doesn't really have a name, but for convenience,
I'll refer to it as the MGP-method. MGP for Mind Gaz Pedal.

It goes like this:

 - I define a set of weekly of daily recurring tasks (5 to 10 tasks is a good number).
 - A typical task is something that takes 1 minute to a few hours.
 - By default, a task has to be accomplished once every day, with the exception of one day per week.
 - Tasks are tracked in a excel grid: columns are tasks, rows are days.
 - Each successful task is green, tolerated exception yellow, and failure red.
 - For each failure (red square), I throw 5 euros into the garbage.
 - Each month, if there were more than 10 failures, the total money thrown for that month is capped to 50 euros (I have yet to reach this cap).
 - Tasks can be completed in advance for a coming day. But never caught up to. When the day is over,
 failed tasks are failed forever.

The list of tasks slowly changes over time. Any task can be freely added. To remove a task, it has to be
completed at least one, else it costs 5 euros to remove.

Here is what April looks like so far:

  As you can see, April will cost at least 30 euros. I've had better months, but this is still not too bad.

Detail of tasks:

 - T1 Run: Jogging routine at least once a week. about 45min. No failures tolerated.
 - T2 IA: At least 30m of AI-related activity per day.
 - T3 Ex: At least 10m of stretching exercise per day to help with my low-back pain
 - T4 p: At least 1m of piano-related activity per day
 - T5 dv: At least 1m of Keybest/typing related activity per day
 - T6 bl: At least one blog article of 50 words per day
 - T7 <1h: Stop the computer and go to bed before 1:00 each day. 2 failures per week tolerated.

This has worked fine for the past months.

Now that I have created a gaz pedal, I can push on it. Gently, so that it won't break, and I'll go faster.

 - T2 IA is now: At least 40m of AI-related activity per day, and at least 2h00 on weekends (friday, saturday, sunday)
 - T7 <1h is now: Stop the computer and go to bed before 0:40 each day. 2 failures per week tolerated.
