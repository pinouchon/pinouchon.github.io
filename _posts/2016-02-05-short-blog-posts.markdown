Every time I set out to write a blog post, I impose myself a "high standard". Even having decided to churn out
[piles of clay](http://blog.codinghorror.com/quantity-always-trumps-quality/), the tendency to want everything to be
perfect comes back : the post must be lengthy, every idea
must be carefully thought out. Well, no. Here's what will happen instead: 
Ideas will be half baked. The reasoning will be flawed. Or else completing the
[challenge](http://pinouchon.github.io/blogging/meta/motivation/2016/01/29/blogging-challenge.html) will be impossible.

Also, maybe blogging writing shorter posts will have the same advantage as programming writing shorter functions (in the
hope that the posts will assemble in a coherent whole, who knows).
