The long awaited ApolloStack (that will enable SQL support with meteor) is finally coming together.

The high-level info can be found here: [http://www.apollostack.com/](http://www.apollostack.com/)
The documentation here: [http://docs.apollostack.com/](http://docs.apollostack.com/)

They mention the existence of [https://astexplorer.net/](https://astexplorer.net/) which I didn't
know about and is pretty cool.
